React Props

Props are arguments passed into React components.
Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.


// Example
// Add a "brand" attribute to the Car element:

// const myelement = <Car brand = "Ford" />;

// The component receives the arguments as a props object:


Pass Data
Props are also how you pass data from one component to another, as parameters.
